$addField[How to test?;For those who want to host them on their bots. You can download the files from the [canary](https://github.com/ddodogames/Dodo-Bot/tree/canary) branch on Github.

Alternatively, you can invite Dodo Canary (using the button below) to a server to directly test latest pre-release build (prefix: \`d?\`).
]
$addField[Introduction;Canary is a way to test pre-release builds of upcoming versions of Dodo-Bot before they eventually release as a stable version.

Builds released in this state are incomplete and may have bugs as a result, so it is not recommended to use them for production purposes.
